A few years ago I participated in a workshop taught by Andr√© Rangel, portuguese artist, about using Max programming to create PS files.
Recently I have been experimenting with using Python scripts for the same.
In this repository I have put 2 scripts, 2 sample PS files created with them and 2 sample images from these sample files (opened in Photoshop, added background, saved as Jpg).
